This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
# Note for Theme
to use the theme, you just need to add query parameters to the url for example 
# http://localhost:3000?theme=1/2
for default you don't need to do that
